## Howe to use this server ðŸ¤·
- create repository called "database" right next to the servers repository.
- inside it you have to create next list of repositories
1. /audio
2. /images
- create .env file in the root of the project
- than you are required to have a golang of version 1.17 at least
- now that you have everything setup just run `make`
in the root of the project
- if you see any errors than debug it and dont be a pussy
